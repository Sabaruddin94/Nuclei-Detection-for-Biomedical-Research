Nuclei Detection for Biomedical Research

This project involves the development of a semantic segmentation model for detecting cell nuclei in biomedical images. 
The tool aims to expedite research in understanding various diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, and heart disease by automating the process of identifying cell nuclei in microscopic images. 
The model uses a U-Net architecture with transfer learning to segment images and identify the regions of interest (nuclei), which are essential for further genetic analysis and drug testing.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build an efficient and accurate model for nuclei segmentation using a deep learning approach. 
This project is part of a larger effort to improve the speed and accuracy of disease research by automating the detection of key biological features in medical images.

Model Architecture
The model is built using the U-Net architecture, which is highly effective for image segmentation tasks. The model consists of:

1. Downsampling Path: Extracts relevant features using a pretrained MobileNetV2 model.
2. Upsampling Path: Restores the spatial dimensions and refines the segmentation.
3. Output Layer: A single convolutional layer with a sigmoid activation for binary segmentation (nucleus vs. background).
   
Code Structure
1. Data Loading & Preprocessing: Scripts to load images and masks, resize, normalize, and augment the data.
2. Model Definition: The U-Net model, using MobileNetV2 for feature extraction.
3. Training: Training the model, monitoring for overfitting using TensorBoard and EarlyStopping.
4. Evaluation: Evaluating the model on test data.
   
Training & TensorBoard Integration
During training, TensorBoard is used to monitor model performance in real-time. This provides useful visualizations such as loss curves, accuracy, and other metrics.
